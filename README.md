# Design to VLSI(RTL to GDS II)
Here, I  cover the basics of Chip Implementation, from designing the logic (RTL) to providing a layout ready for fabrication (GDS).

The evolution of integrated circuits, from the groundbreaking invention in 1964 to modern processors like Intel's Montecito in 2006, highlights the remarkable progress in technology. This journey—from 2,300 transistors on the Intel 4004 to over 1.7 billion transistors—demonstrates humanity's ability to push the boundaries of innovation and functionality, laying the foundation for the advanced computing systems we rely on today.

The Intel Core i7-6950X Extreme Edition, also known as Broadwell-E, exemplifies the cutting-edge advancements in processor technology achieved by 2016. Here’s a breakdown of its key features and significance:

1.Fabrication Technology:

The processor was built using a 14-nanometer FinFET process.

14nm refers to the size of the transistors and other features on the chip, enabling higher density and lower power consumption.

FinFET is a 3D transistor design that improves efficiency and performance compared to earlier planar transistors.


2.Processing Power:

It features 10 cores, each capable of handling two threads simultaneously (via Hyper-Threading), resulting in 20 threads running in parallel.

This parallel processing capability makes it ideal for multi-threaded applications like video editing, 3D rendering, and complex simulations.

3.Memory Capacity:

Equipped with 25 MB of L3 cache, this large memory allows the processor to store frequently accessed data closer to the cores, improving speed and reducing latency.

4.Performance Specifications:

The chip operates at frequencies in the gigahertz range, ensuring high-speed processing for demanding tasks.
5.
Physical Size:

The die measures 246 mm², a substantial size, indicative of the complexity and integration of multiple components on the same chip.

6.Transistor Count:

The processor incorporates over 3.2 billion transistors, a testament to the density and complexity of modern chip designs.

This processor's features illustrate the exponential growth of computing power enabled by innovations in microprocessor design. It pushes the boundaries of performance, energy efficiency, and integration, meeting the needs of modern applications while exemplifying the principles of Moore's Law.

This is a kind of above graph where you can see that we have plotted two things. On the  bottom, we have the year where we have one scale on the right is productivity which is  how many transistors or theoretical transistors each staff and engineer can deal with,  and you see that has grown exponentially because this is a logarithmic graph but, on the  left, here, we have the logical transistors per chip according to Moore’s law which has grown on an exponent. The only thing is that you see that the scale of growth on the logic transistor per chip is much larger than the productivity of how much a person can deal with even with the different tools that we use to help us grow this exponentially and this has caused a gap to come along. One of the things that how we can go and close this Gap or what we can do without all these transistors that we’re putting on a chip.
